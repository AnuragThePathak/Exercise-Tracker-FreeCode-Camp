# [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker)

- This is my solution to the [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker) project on freeCodeCamp Backend Development Certification.
- This project is a RESTful API that allows users to track their progress in a variety of exercises.
- The API is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
